    "Books are essential for personal growth, knowledge acquisition, and entertainment. However, in Kenya, finding the right books that cater to diverse tastes has been a challenge. High book prices, limited library access, and a lack of book variety have hindered the reading experience for many Kenyan book enthusiasts. Recognizing this issue, Lonestar Incorporated, a Kenyan startup, has secured funding from Venture Capitalists to revolutionize the book market in Kenya. They aim to provide a wide range of affordable books, both digital and hardcopy, to their customers. To ensure an exceptional reading experience, Lonestar Inc. is launching a website where users can explore and purchase books. However, in order for their website and company to be successful, they recognize the need for a recommendation system of books that will recommend books to users based on their previous purchases and books other users with similar interests have rated highly.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have decided to hire their fellow startup company known as Regex Inc., which is a new company consisting of Data Scientists, Analysts, and even Data Engineers. Since the company is still relatively new it does not consist of a lot of personnel. However, the current personnel have been given the task of building a recommendation system for Lonestar Inc. to use for their website. They are to deploy this model to their site with the help of those who created their website and they are finally to present what they did to a board of members consisting of Lonestar Inc. members to show their results of modeling.\n"

    "Lonestar Incorporated, a Kenyan startup aiming to revolutionize the book market in Kenya, faces the challenge of providing an exceptional reading experience to their customers. The primary problem is the lack of a book recommendation system on their website. Users currently have no efficient way to discover books tailored to their preferences and reading history. Lonestar Inc. seeks to implement a recommendation system that can suggest books to users based on their previous purchases and ratings by users with similar interests. The problem at hand is to design, build, and deploy an effective book recommendation system that enhances user engagement, drives book sales, and improves the overall reading experience on their website."
